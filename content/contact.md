# Contact

Interested in working together on **infrastructure planning**, **educational platforms**, or **systems that need to function under constraint**?

I take on projects that align with my operating principles: consent-first design, local-first function, and systems built for endurance rather than attention.

---

## What I Take On

### Infrastructure Planning
- Off-grid energy system design and analysis
- Constraint-driven technical specifications
- Code compliance documentation (NEC, Title 24)
- Multi-tier budget analysis with transparent tradeoffs

### Educational Platforms
- COPPA-compliant learning system architecture
- Privacy-by-design data governance
- Age-adaptive interface design
- Consent-embedded system structures

### Technical Consulting
- Multi-agent coordination and governance design
- Documentation systems and specification architecture
- Local-first system design
- Resilient infrastructure planning

---

## Good Fit

- Projects with clear constraints and measurable outcomes
- Work that requires clarity over complexity
- Long-term partnerships over one-off builds
- Problems where endurance matters more than speed

## Not a Fit

- "Move fast and break things" approaches
- Projects requiring collection of children's PII without consent architecture
- Marketing-first / technology-second initiatives
- Work that cannot be documented or governed

3. **Your audience**: Who will rely on this system?
4. **What success looks like**: How will you know it worked?

**Type**: Technical consulting / infrastructure planning
**Status**: Complete
**Values demonstrated**: Clarity Over Complexity, Consent Is Structural, Endurance Over Speed, Local-First Design

**Type**: Operational infrastructure / governance design
**Status**: Operational
**Values demonstrated**: Human Agency First, Human-AI Collaboration, Clarity Over Complexity, Consent Is Structural

How do you extend capability through AI without surrendering judgment? This case study documents the governance structure that enables all other projects — defined agent boundaries, immutable decision records, and session continuity protocols that preserve human authority at scale.

# Off-Grid Solar System Design

## Constraint-Driven Planning for a California Homestead

---

**Project**: Residential off-grid solar system design
**Client**: Homeowner, Central California
**Status**: Complete — ready for construction
**Deliverable**: 6 technical reports (337 pages) + 3-page client summary
**Role**: Design, analysis, and planning — not installation

---

## The Problem

A California homeowner needed to move off-grid. The daily load was 16 kWh. The budget was uncertain. The constraints were not:

- NEC 2020 and California Title 24 compliance required
- Seismic design considerations for ground mount
- Some work could be DIY; some legally required a licensed electrician
- Existing solar panels on-site (potential reuse)
- Battery lead times of 4-12 weeks

The client needed to make a decision. They needed to understand what they were deciding.

---

## The Approach

Instead of delivering a single recommendation, the project produced **three distinct budget tiers** with transparent tradeoffs:

| Tier | Cost | 20-Year TCO | Risk Profile |
|------|------|-------------|--------------|
| Budget | $21,000 | $38,500 | Higher maintenance, shorter warranty |
| Mid-Range | $27,500 | $32,500 | Lowest lifecycle cost, balanced risk |
| Premium | $40,000 | $45,000 | Maximum redundancy, longest warranty |

Each tier included:
- Complete bill of materials
- Installation timeline (Gantt chart)
- Code compliance matrix (NEC 690, 706, 710, 705, 250)
- 20-year maintenance projections

---

## The Boundary

The project explicitly separated what the homeowner **could safely do themselves** from what **required a licensed electrician**:

**Homeowner scope (legal, safe)**:
- Ground mount assembly
- Conduit runs
- Equipment labeling
- System monitoring setup

**Licensed electrician required**:
- AC/DC connections
- Main panel work
- Utility interconnection
- Final inspection sign-off

This distinction protected the client from liability while preserving their agency over the parts they could control.

---

## The Outcome

**Delivered**:
- 6 technical reports (337 pages)
- 230+ item safety compliance checklist
- 3-page non-technical client summary
- Supply chain alert (EG4 batteries: 4-12 week lead time)

**Identified savings**:
- $4,560 by reusing existing on-site solar panels
- $81,000 advantage of LiFePO4 over AGM batteries (20-year comparison)

**Design choice**:
- Ground mount selected over roof mount
- Rationale: no structural modifications, easier maintenance, better thermal performance, 25+ year lifespan vs 10-year ballasted alternative

---

## Values in Practice

**Clarity Over Complexity**
Three budget tiers with transparent breakdown. Non-technical summary for decision-makers. Deep technical specs for engineers and inspectors. The client could understand what they were choosing without needing to understand everything.

**Consent Is Structural**
Four execution paths provided (Budget/Mid-Range/Premium + DIY vs Professional split). The client chose their own risk tolerance. The system didn't choose for them.

**Endurance Over Speed**
Ground mount with 25-year fixed structure chosen over faster-to-install 10-year ballasted system. Higher initial cost, lower lifetime cost, fewer failure points.

**Local-First Design**
System designed to function when grid is absent, utility support is unavailable, and institutional infrastructure cannot be relied upon. That was the entire point.

---

## What This Demonstrates

Complex decisions don't require complex communication. A 337-page technical archive and a 3-page client summary can coexist. The depth exists for those who need it. The clarity exists for those who need to decide.

Constraint was the input. Legibility was the output.

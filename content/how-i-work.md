# How I Work

These principles guide every project, system, and engagement.

---

## Clarity Over Complexity

If a system cannot be understood by the people who rely on it, it is incomplete.

---

## Endurance Over Speed

I build systems that last, not systems that launch fast. Durability and repairability matter more than novelty.

---

## Human Agency First

Technology supports human decision-making. It does not replace responsibility or obscure accountability.

---

## Consent Is Structural

Consent is embedded into system design, governance, and data flow — not bolted on as a checkbox. This is non-negotiable when working with children or vulnerable populations.

---

## Local-First Design

Systems should function when connectivity fails, institutions disappear, or abundance is absent.

---

## Quiet Work

I measure success by continued function, not attention. If you've never heard of a system I built, and it's still running, that's the point.

---

## Human-AI Collaboration

I work as a single operator in deliberate collaboration with AI tools. The judgment is mine. The capability is extended. This is intelligent co-creation in practice, not theory.

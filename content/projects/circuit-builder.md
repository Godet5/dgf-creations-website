# Circuit Builder ⚡

**Interactive electronics learning platform with modular ES6+ architecture - hands-on STEM education through gamified circuit design**

## What It Does

Drag-and-drop circuit construction with real-time simulation. Build circuits, see them work, learn electronics principles through immediate feedback. From simple LED circuits to complex logic gates.

## Learning Progression

**Ages 8-10**: Basic concepts - electricity flow, simple circuits with batteries and bulbs
**Ages 11-13**: Circuit types - series, parallel, resistors, LEDs, measurements
**Ages 14-17**: Advanced - logic gates, digital circuits, circuit analysis, Ohm's law
**Ages 18+**: Professional skills - PCB design, industry standards, certification prep

## Game Mechanics

- **Drag & Drop Interface** - Intuitive component placement
- **Real-time Simulation** - Immediate feedback on circuit behavior
- **Tutorial System** - Progressive skill development with character guidance
- **Challenges** - Structured problems with increasing complexity
- **Sandbox Mode** - Free exploration and creative design
- **Measurement Tools** - Virtual multimeter and oscilloscope

## Educational Features

**Skill Tracking** - Competency development across circuit concepts
**Achievement System** - Recognition for milestones and creative solutions
**Portfolio** - Collection of completed circuits and designs
**Character Guidance** - AI mentors (Tortellini for technical, Sallie for organization)

## Privacy & Safety

**COPPA Compliant by Design**:
- No account creation required for basic features
- Local storage only - progress stays on device
- Zero collection of personally identifiable information
- Age-specific protections (maximum for ages 8-13)
- Anonymous gameplay

## Technical Stack

- **Architecture**: Modular ES6+ with 7-module system
- **Production**: Port 8080 operational
- **Integration**: HBC character system, AI Tutor analytics
- **Compliance**: Privacy-by-design with COPPA utilities

## Access

**Local development**: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/circuit_builder_enhanced.html`

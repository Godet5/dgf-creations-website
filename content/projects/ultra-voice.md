# ULTRA Voice System 🎙️

**Voice-controlled autonomous development team - Not just voice chat, a complete multi-agent development platform**

## What It Does

Speak a command → AI orchestrator spawns specialized agents → They collaborate via specs → Results synthesized back to voice. An entire development team controlled by your voice, running on your phone.

## Architecture

```
YOU (Voice) → ORCHESTRATOR → Specialized Agents → Validation → Voice Output
```

### Components

**Voice Layer**
- Speech-to-text (Termux + Android)
- Text-to-speech (gTTS + mpv)
- Natural language synthesis

**Orchestration**
- Intent parsing from natural language
- Task decomposition by complexity
- Automatic agent assignment
- Dependency graph generation

**Agent Management**
- Spawn specialized agents (developer, designer, tester, security)
- Monitor progress via dashboard
- Self-validation with quality checks
- Result aggregation & synthesis

## Example Workflow

**You speak:** *"Build a video app with modern UI"*

**System:**
1. Parses intent → Creates trace ID
2. Spawns agents: designer (UI mockups), developer (API), tester (QA)
3. Agents collaborate via specs (no conflicts)
4. Validates results
5. **Speaks back:** *"Task complete! All four tasks finished successfully."*

## Key Features

- **Multi-provider failover** - Claude CLI → Ollama → Claude API (offline capable)
- **Voice-first interface** - Hands-free development
- **Spec-based coordination** - Agents never conflict
- **Self-validation** - Security scans, test validation, auto-fix
- **Knowledge accumulation** - Every session logged, specs become templates

## Technical Stack

- **AI Providers**: Claude (Anthropic), Ollama (local), Gemini
- **Voice**: gTTS, mpv, Termux speech APIs
- **Orchestration**: Custom bash scripts + Python intent parser
- **Platform**: Android/Termux

## Performance

**Token Optimization**: 90% token savings vs naive approach - only complex cases use Claude (~3500 tokens)

**Speed**:
- Simple (2-3 tasks): <5 min
- Medium (5-8 tasks): 10-20 min
- Complex (10-20 tasks): 30-60 min

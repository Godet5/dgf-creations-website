# DGF-Creations

**Production-ready platforms for education, creative tools, and custom business applications.**

We build **AI-powered educational systems**, **web applications**, and **creative development tools** — from architecture to deployment.

> Currently serving clients in mobile service businesses, educational platforms, and R&D teams.

## What We Do

We build **systems**, not just demos:

- **Educational Platforms**
  Character-driven tutor systems, COPPA-first design, playful STEM learning worlds.

- **Creative Tools & Engines**
  Keystroke music, voice-driven dev agents, visual discovery interfaces.

- **Custom Web Applications**
  Full-stack business platforms with payments, client portals, and automated workflows.

> **Philosophy**: Technology should adapt to humans, not the other way around.
> Privacy-first. COPPA-compliant. Built for real people solving real problems.

## About DGF-Creations

We're an experimental studio obsessed with **tools that amplify human creativity and learning**.

- Human-speed creativity with AI collaboration
- Privacy-first, data-minimal from the start
- Comfortable living where prototypes and production systems overlap

If you're building something that doesn't fit neatly into a box — especially in education, music, or human-computer interaction — we probably want to see it.

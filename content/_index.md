# Sierra Cole

**Builder of Resilient Systems**

I pair human judgment with adaptive tools to produce practical, durable systems. My work spans educational platforms, off-grid infrastructure planning, and privacy-respecting technology design — projects united by a focus on consent, local-first function, and long-term resilience.

> "A system that only works under perfect conditions is a liability."

## Focus Areas

### Systems Design
Architecture and infrastructure that remains legible and maintainable. Documentation that serves the people who rely on the system, not just the people who built it.

### Education & Habit Formation
Platforms designed for consent, privacy, and long-term engagement. COPPA-compliant from day one. Built for children and families who deserve protection, not extraction.

### Resilient Infrastructure
Off-grid planning, local-first design, constraint-driven engineering. Systems that function when connectivity fails, institutions disappear, or abundance is absent.

## How I Work

I work as a single operator in deliberate collaboration with AI tools. The judgment is mine. The capability is extended.

My operating principles: **Clarity over complexity. Endurance over speed. Human agency first. Consent is structural. Local-first design. Quiet work.**

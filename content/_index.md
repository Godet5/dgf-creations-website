# DGF-Creations

**Experimental studio meets research notebook.**

We design **AI-powered educational platforms** and **creative tools** that feel like play, respect privacy, and actually ship.

---

## What We Do

We build **systems**, not just demos:

- **Educational Platforms**
  Character-driven tutor systems, COPPA-first design, playful STEM learning worlds.

- **Creative Tools & Engines**
  Keystroke music, voice-driven dev agents, visual discovery interfaces.

- **Custom R&D & Consulting**
  Multi-agent architectures, learning experience design, and technical deep dives.

> **Philosophy**: Technology should adapt to humans, not the other way around.
> Privacy-first. COPPA-compliant. Built for real people solving real problems.

## Featured Platforms

*Production-ready systems you can adapt, extend, or learn from.*

### Keystroke Symphony 🎹

Real-time **keyboard-to-music** synthesis engine that turns typing into sound.

- Zero-latency audio (NumPy + sounddevice)
- Dynamic tempo & pitch control
- Recording & playback of entire typing sessions
- Works on desktop & mobile (Termux)

### ULTRA Voice System 🎙️

Voice-controlled **autonomous development team** – not just chat, a multi-agent dev platform.

- Speak a goal → orchestrator spawns specialized agents
- Agents collaborate via specs and validation passes
- Results summarized back to you in natural voice

## Who We Build For

### For Educators & Learning Teams 🎓

- COPPA-compliant from day one
- Character-driven learning that kids actually enjoy
- Transparent, configurable behavior – no black-box "edutainment"

### For Builders & Researchers 🔬

- Real code, real constraints, real deployments
- Multi-agent orchestration, local-first tooling, voice control
- Open to collaboration on experimental platforms

## About DGF-Creations

We're an experimental studio obsessed with **tools that amplify human creativity and learning**.

- Human-speed creativity with AI collaboration
- Privacy-first, data-minimal from the start
- Comfortable living where 🚧 prototypes and production systems overlap

If you're building something that doesn't fit neatly into a box — especially in education, music, or human-computer interaction — we probably want to see it.

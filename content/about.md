# About DGF-Creations

**Experimental studio meets research notebook.**

We build systems that amplify human creativity and learning through thoughtful application of AI. Not flashy demos - production-ready platforms solving real problems.

## Philosophy

**Human-speed creativity with AI collaboration**
Technology should adapt to humans, not the other way around. We build tools that respect attention, privacy, and the messy reality of how people actually work.

**Privacy-first, compliance-built-in**
COPPA-compliant from day one. Educational platforms designed with maximum protection for children. Local-first data. Transparency in every interaction.

**Building in public**
Experimental projects and prototypes. Some work locally, some are in active development. Honest status on each project page.

## Approach

**Keystroke Symphony** explores the intersection of everyday computing and musical creativity.

**ULTRA Voice** proves multi-agent development can work hands-free on a phone.

**Circuit Builder** makes electronics education accessible through play, not lectures.

**HBC Platform** demonstrates that AI tutoring can be personal without being invasive.

## The Work

Built on Android/Termux. Orchestrated through multi-agent systems. Voice-controlled. Privacy-protected. Shipped.

**Status**: Experimental studio. Projects in various stages of development.

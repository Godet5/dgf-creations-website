# About

Sierra Cole is the founder of **De Gode Fem LLC**, a planning and creation studio that pairs human judgment with adaptive tools to produce practical, durable systems.

Her work includes educational platforms, off-grid infrastructure planning, and privacy-respecting technology design — projects united by a focus on consent, local-first function, and long-term resilience.

Sierra builds for constraint: her systems are designed to work when resources are limited, connectivity is unreliable, and institutional support is absent. She documents rigorously, designs for legibility, and measures success by endurance rather than attention.

## Founder Statement

I build systems because I've seen what happens when they fail.

My work comes from proximity to constraint — limited resources, rural infrastructure gaps, situations where things needed to function even when conditions weren't ideal. I learned that a system which only works under perfect circumstances isn't a system. It's a liability waiting to be called.

Through De Gode Fem, I focus on pairing tools with human judgment rather than replacing it. I care about clarity, consent, and endurance. I build things meant to function when attention is low, time is short, and support is thin.

I'm not interested in innovation that performs. I'm interested in work that reduces harm, expands agency, and keeps functioning in the background of real lives. If it lasts and protects people, it's doing its job.

## The Work

**Focus areas:**

- **Systems Design** — Architecture and infrastructure that remains legible and maintainable
- **Education & Habit Formation** — Platforms designed for consent, privacy, and long-term engagement
- **Resilient Infrastructure** — Off-grid planning, local-first design, constraint-driven engineering
